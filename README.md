# SingleTreeDetectionFunctions

This code is a result of my master thesis "Identifikation von potenziellen Stützenbäumen mittels Fernerkundungsdaten". 
It contains different filter and single tree detection methods which can be combined to all possible variants. For every combination
extraction rate, match rate, commission and ommission error are calculated. As it was my first longer code in python, the
programming could be optimized.

As input data a tiff-file is needed with the correct naming (explained in the code). Furthermore multiple input and output paths have
to be defined. If the tiff-file doesn't have to be clipped by a polygon, the polygon option has to be set to False.
